# Optical-flow based drone obstacle avoidance algorithm

This is one part of my master degree project in Beihang University.The goal of my project is to achieve an obstacle-free algorithm for drone by using only one camera. Yet, I have done the validation test of my algorithm on the GAZOBO simulation environment, the control loop was consturcted on the ROS platform and the optical flow estimation is based on OpenCV functions. In the next step, the test will be hold on the real drone.
